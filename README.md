Plotly_Development
Roza needed to create a dashboard for her volunteers to show the sample data where volunteers can identify the top ten samples in their belly buttons. That way if improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza’s volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel or not. 

I have created attractive charts in Plotly and used JavaScript to make these charts Dynamic and customizable; to show Roza filter belly button data and to display information to each Roza’s volunteer. Running a local server allows to test code on the specific computer but deploying the project on to a public server enables to share it with working fellows and study groups.
